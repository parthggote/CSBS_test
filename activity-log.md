# Activity Log

## Progress Summary (Up to Now)

### 1. **Initial Setup & Planning**
- Reviewed existing Next.js frontend and planned backend API structure.
- Created `activity-log.md` to track progress.

### 2. **Backend/API Implementation**
- Implemented API endpoints for `/api/resources`, `/api/users`, `/api/settings`, and `/api/auth` using Next.js App Router.
- Integrated MongoDB for persistent storage (using the `CSBS` database and appropriate collections).
- Added JWT-based authentication and role-based access control for admins and students.
- All API routes use named exports and Next.js conventions.

### 3. **Admin Dashboard Features**
- **Event Management:**
  - All event CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) use the `Events` collection.
  - Admins can add, edit, delete, and toggle event status.
- **Resources Management:**
  - Resources are managed by type (hackathons, pyqs, certifications, interviews) and stored in their respective collections.
  - Admins can add, edit, and delete resources for any type.
  - Resource creation supports file upload (PDF, DOCX, etc.) using MongoDB GridFS.
  - Resource fields include type, category, year, semester, examType, downloads, etc.
- **User Management:**
  - Full CRUD for users via `/api/users`.
  - Admins can add, edit, and delete users.
- **Settings Management:**
  - Platform settings are managed via `/api/settings`.
- **Feedback/Toasts:**
  - All admin actions provide success/error feedback.
- **Robust error handling:**
  - All fetches use safe JSON parsing and defensive coding for arrays.

### 4. **Authentication & Signup**
- JWT tokens are stored in HTTPOnly cookies.
- Signup page allows registration as student or admin.
- Login page redirects users based on role (admin → `/admin`, student → `/dashboard`).

### 5. **File Uploads & Downloads**
- File uploads use MongoDB GridFS for storage.
- Download links stream files from GridFS and increment a download counter in the resource document (optimistic UI update included).

### 6. **Student-Facing Features**
- Resources page fetches and displays all resource types and events from the backend.
- All relevant fields (examType, year, semester, downloads, etc.) are shown for each resource.
- Events tab displays all events from the `Events` collection.
- Download counter is shown and updated optimistically.

### 7. **Code Quality & Robustness**
- All `.map` and `.length` usages on possibly undefined arrays are guarded with `Array.isArray` or optional chaining.
- Defensive coding throughout to prevent runtime errors.

### 8. **Other Improvements**
- Activity log kept up to date.
- UI/UX improvements for both admin and student dashboards.

**The platform now supports robust, full-stack CRUD for users, resources, settings, and events, with secure authentication, file uploads, download tracking, and a modern, user-friendly interface for both admins and students.**
